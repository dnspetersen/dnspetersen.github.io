				<h3>Objective of the project</h3>
				<p>Create a different experience for wine buying from other wine stores, targeting a consumer that hasn't a fully understatement of wines and helping them in the offer of new wines of the market.</p>
				<h3>My roles</h3>
				<p>My roles in this project were the development of the user interface with a connection with the artwork done with the photographer. For this project, I was a full stack designer, from all the user interface design, testing and front-end/back-end development of the e-commerce. </p>

				<h3>The problem</h3>
				<p>Comparing to conventional wine stores, based in more traditional approach for the user with ads, hello-bars, for WineMania was needed a solution with a selected wine cart with a young approach but that reaches also the user who is older and understand wine selections.</p>
				<h3>The solution</h3>
				<p>One of the cumbersome for this project was to understand the real need of this target group. There was a lot of interference in the process, but I was able to manage all the expectations, keep a clear and minimalistic design that would stand out the photos and keep the attention for the store. Typography like Slab Fino and using geometric shapes gave a fresh look, without losing the relevance for an older target.</p>
