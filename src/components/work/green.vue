				<h3>The problem</h3>
				<p>Work with all the range of products in one brand that represents the newest experience of mobility in the market without competing with the design of the products. Create a interface that consolidates the brand to the market and helps the consumer understand the products, creating the desire for it.</p>

				<h3>The solution</h3>
				<p>After the discussions and research, the ideas that came out were that for each touch point was essential that only the plain plan would be necessary for this stage, avoiding to compete with all the actual usage of the product. It was necessary to make clear that the Green Ride is about getting the experience and not the experience itself. The brand brings the conception of the electric mobility, being minimalist and modern, being versatile for all the products and stating this message for all the consumers. </p>
