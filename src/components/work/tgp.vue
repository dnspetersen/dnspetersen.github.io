				<h3>The problem</h3>
				<p>The main cumbersome for this project was to break a pattern for this legal market, of being serious and formals but manage to attend all the expectations on the services that are being offered. 
We had a good number of meetings to decide colors, medias and content that had the same importance to communicate with such diverse public. 
The legal area has a lot of compliance and regulations regarding publicity, and to innovate was a challenge to be different and still be in total compliance with those agreements.</p>

				<h3>The solution</h3>
				<p>The main outcome was to break the idea of lawyers has to be formals, they can be good and still connect to you. For that cutting the tie on the logo brings this feeling of breaking formalities in a abstract ways, keeping a little of the kind of communication that is done by this market. 
The content was planned to be in a way that every kind of media that is posted has the same importance throughout the user's eye, balancing the modern and the formal environment that is essential for this market.</p>
