There was a lot of interference in the process, but I was able to manage all the expectations, keep a clear and minimalistic design that would stand out the photos and keep the attention for the store. Typography like Slab Fino and using geometric shapes gave a fresh look, without losing the relevance for an older target.</p>\n\t\t</figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n\t<figure>\n\t\t<span><img src=\"../../assets/desk_winemania1.jpg\" alt=\"WineMania\"></span>\n\t\t<span><img src=\"../../assets/desk_winemania2.jpg\" alt=\"WineMania\"></span>\n\t</figure>\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\"It was an amazing time for learning about wines and online stores and to know all grapes variations in many special countries.\n\t\tThe WineMania's page is available on site <a href=\"//www.winemania.com.br\" target=\"_blank\">www.winemania.com.br</a>\"\n\t</blockquote>\n</div>\n",null]}
